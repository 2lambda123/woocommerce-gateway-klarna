=== WOOCOMMERCE KLARNA GATEWAY ===

By Niklas HÃ¶gefjord - http://krokedil.com/


== DESCRIPTION ==

Klarna Gateway is a plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing your customers to get their products first and pay by invoice to Klarna later (http://www.klarna.com/). This plugin utilizes the Klarna Invoice (Standard Integration type).

When the order is passed to Klarna a credit record of the customer is made. If the check turns out all right, Klarna creates an invoice in their system. After you as a merchant completes the order in WooCommerce, you need to log in to Klarna and approve/send the invoice.

Klarna is a great payment alternative for merchants and customers in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany and the Nederlands.


== IMPORTANT NOTE ==

You *must* enable SSL from the settings panel to use this plugin in live mode - this is for your customers safety and security.

This plugin does not currently support Klarna Account, Campaigns or Mobile payments.
